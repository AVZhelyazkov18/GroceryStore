<p align=center>We want to build a web application to run in a store. There will be two types of users in the system - employees and customers. When starting the program, the user is given the option to choose how they want to use it.

## Description of the application:

Each employee has a unique employee_id. Each product has a unique product_id. It is important to note that different product categories have different characteristics and structure.

Login as an employee:
Product management: add, change and delete products. Search products: by id, by name, by price (interval), by stock quantity. Add a product. Change product (by id). Delete a product (by id, the ids of the other products do not need to change in this action). Employee sorting. Change order status. Possible statuses are: New, Processing, Courier, Completed. View all orders sorted in chronological order, with the most recent order placed at the top.
